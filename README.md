Corpo-Chat
==========

Proper communication and knowledge transfer within company are vital 
matters. Email and office communicators are effective however they lack 
of broadcast and history inspection mechanism. It's especially important 
for new employees and remote workers.

One of possible solutions is creation of topic oriented collaborative 
spaces. In first version space will be simple chat room. User may 
create or join many rooms and take part in discussion.

Conversation in every room is public and recorded for future use. Public 
is used as "all people having proper permissions". We shall say public 
to certain group, but group may change over time.

Posted knowledge (in a form of messages) are searchable. Hashtags helps 
to qualify messages to certain topics or categories. Hashtags may be 
used 
to mention certan user. Mentioned user is notified with proper means 
(popup/email/sms).

Project can be easily deployed in internal company network.
