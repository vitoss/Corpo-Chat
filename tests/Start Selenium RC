  Selenium RC (Remote Control) is  a portable software testing framework, which allows to write automated test for a web
  application in a programming language so as Java, Python, Ruby, Perl, .NET and PHP. Unlike ordinary Selenium IDE, which
  enabled to carry the test, out only on the Firefox web browser, in Selenium RC is possible to choose diffrent web browsers.
